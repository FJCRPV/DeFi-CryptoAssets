    "a3":  "By providing liquidity to a pool on Uniswap V3, the source of yield are \
        the trading fees. Liquidity providers (LPs) earn a portion of said fees on each \
        swap that occurs within the price range they provide liquidity to as a reward for \
        enabling these trades. This design allows LPs to simulate active market-making \
        strategies and potentially generate higher returns on deposited capital. \
        The main technical risk is impermanent loss, which arises when the relative \
        price of the two provided assets diverges from the initial ratio at the \
        time of deposit. As a result, when the liquidity is withdrawn, the dollar \
        value of the assets might be less than if one had simply held them outside \
        the pool. In Uniswap V3, this is further influenced by concentrated liquidity: \
        if the market price moves outside the LPs specified range, the position \
        becomes inactive and stops earning fees, with the position fully converted \
        into the less valuable asset.", # free text answer to question 3

    "a7":  "Yes, I had to approve token spending before supplying WBTC to the \
        Aave protocol. This is a standard step in ERC-20 token interactions.\
        ERC-20 tokens, like WBTC, require an explicit approval from the user \
        before a smart contract can transfer tokens on their behalf. This is \
        a security measure to ensure that only trusted contracts can access the userâ€™s tokens. \
        In this case, when supplying WBTC to Aave, the first transaction was an 'Approve' \
        transaction, allowing the protocol's smart contract to spend up to a certain amount \
        of WBTC from my wallet. The second transaction was the actual deposit, where Aave \
        transfered the approved amount of WBTC from my wallet into their lending pool.", # free text answer to question 7

    "a13": "By supplying WBTC and borrowing additional EURS to buy even more WBTC, \
        I effectively created a leveraged long position on WBTC. This amplifies both \
        potential gains and losses. The main financial risk is that if WBTC decreases \
        in value, the value of my collateral drops while my debt remains the same, \
        causing the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to rise. As DeFi lending protocols usually \
        require overcollateralization due to pseudo-anonimity, the Health Factor, \
        which reflects how safe the loan is, will decline as a result. If it falls \
        below 1, the position becomes vulnerable to liquidation, where Aave can sell \
        my collateral to repay part of the loan, possibly even incurring a penalty. \
        This exposes the strategy to significant liquidation risk due to market volatility.", # free text answer to question 13
